# Format: h3_id (str), category_id (str), expected_seconds (int), tolerance_seconds (int), notes (str), verified_date (YYYY-MM-DD), verified_by (str)

# This dataset contains hand-verified drive times for specific hex-category pairs.
# Use these to validate that the T_hex + D_anchor composition produces reasonable results.
#
# Tolerance: acceptable deviation from expected value (typically 10% of expected time)
